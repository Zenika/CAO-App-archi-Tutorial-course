# First version

This is the first version of your booking / renting application

## Context

You juste started your new business, it looks pretty good but you need an app to manage your customers and your pool. For now you need a database, an app to manage your business logic and a web page to search for disponibility, add customers, make a booking...

## What you need to produce

 - A use case UML diagram with interactions between actors and your system
 - A sequence diagram to describe the booking / renting process
 - A class diagram with your data model
 - If you have time, an MVP with CRUD operations (no CSS needed :grin:)

_Keep it simple, less functionalities, more quality_
