# Second version

This is the second version of your booking / renting application

## Context

Your new business is looking good, you just hired 2 new collaborators, one to help with the customers requests on bookings, one to manage the money side of things, making bills and sending them to customers. Additionnaly, your salesman asks for a mobile app to check the state of your <insert_your_product> state when the user get it back

## What you need to produce

 - A use case UML diagram with interactions between actors and your system
 - An updated class diagram with your new data model if needed
 - Two different clients, one for booking (you can reuse previous work) and one for managing sales and bills

_Keep it simple, less functionalities, more quality_
