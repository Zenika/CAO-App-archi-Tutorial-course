# Third Version

This is the third version of your booking / renting application

## Context

You're going international!! Your business is flourishing and you have new clients all over the world every day. But it's getting harder and harder fo your employees to use your "good ol' monolith" to manage the company. You're gonna need a big change to adapt to the new international context and to ensure that all of different services that work for you can do their job in the easiest way possible.

Your company is now a 1000 employees, offices in Paris, London, New york, Tokyo, Melbourne (just opened) and Kuala Lumpur (your best seller).
The services are Renting, Accounting, HR, Marketing, Stock Management et the brand new Mobile divison.

Your goal is to propose two architectural designs to help the growth of the company and "slay the monolith".

Good luck!

## What you need to produce

 - Two different architectures for the application/applications
 - One page (of TEXT) at least for each proposition, not technical. You can add diagrams and design schemas if needed
 - Explain why and how you would implement these architectures. Benefits and pitfall to watch for, how you plan to split concerns, etc...

_Keep it simple, use your own words, search the web_
